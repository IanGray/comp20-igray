Lab: 6 - JSON


Files: index.html, data.json -- provided
	   lab.js - script that parses the JSON
	   style.css - stlye sheet -- modified from an inclass example


Coloborators: Owen Martin - Helped me out when I was having issues with parse not being found (Ming later helped me with this issue)

A lot of code was inspired/addapted from the JSON Http Request page on the W3schools website. url:  http://www.w3schools.com/json/json_http.asp


Objectives: I have sucessfully opened, parsed, and desplayed the JSON file.  Also for part 2 I attempted to open the JSON from a remote source, but no file was desplayed.  I belive that this is due to the same-orgin policy, which prevented the file from an external source from being opend on the gh-pages hosted page.  There would be potental security risks of unknown javascript being exicuted if the policy didn't exist. 

Time spent: This assignment took aproximently 2 hour to complete.

Notes:  Thanks Ming for the last minute help and telling me not to worry about the token.
