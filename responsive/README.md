Assignment: Lab 4

Objectives: I believe that I have achieved all the objectives of this lab.  I have created a css file (responsive.css) which reacts to page width by displaying a different portion of the softwarel.png image.

Notes: 
	* I utilized the "last rule wins" principle of css so that the proper image would show
	* I originally used min-width, but switched to max-width to accomidate the corner cases (ie at exactly 1200px wide the "how the project leader understood it" image should be shown)
	* I spend a fair amount of time shifting one or two px on each case to make the image line up and not move when the image changes.

Time Spent: This took around an hour and a half to complete.
