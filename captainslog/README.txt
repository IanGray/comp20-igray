Files: index.html

Objectives: This program sucesfully reads in user logs, updates the log section, and stores them in local storage.  Much of this is accomplished through the use of jQuery.  Note that I chose concatinate logs into one string and update a single local storage entry.  By doing this I was able to insure that the messages would always be in the same order, without needing to sort them, regardless of what browser (someone on piazza mentioned that different browsers load local storage in different orders).

Time spent: This assignment took aproximently 2.5 hours to complete.
